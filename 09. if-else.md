## Decision Making in Python with If/Else Statements

#### Introduction

In our daily lives, we constantly make decisions based on conditions. For example, if it's raining, we might decide not to go to school. In Python programming, we use similar decision-making processes using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements. This tutorial explains how to implement these conditional statements in Python.

#### Taking User Input and Type Casting

1. **Taking User Input**: By default, the `input()` function in Python returns data as a string. To take numerical input, we use type casting:
   ```python
   age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
   print("Your age is:", age)
   ```
2. **Type Casting**: We use the `int()` function to convert the string input to an integer.

#### Basic If/Else Statement

We use the `if` statement to execute code based on a condition:
```python
if age > 18:
    print("You can drive")
else:
    print("You cannot drive")
```
- Here, if the user's age is greater than 18, the program will print "You can drive". Otherwise, it will print "You cannot drive".

#### Conditional Operators

Conditional operators are used to compare values:
- `>` : Greater than
- `<` : Less than
- `>=` : Greater than or equal to
- `<=` : Less than or equal to
- `==` : Equal to
- `!=` : Not equal to

Examples:
```python
print(age > 18)  # Returns True or False
print(age == 18) # Returns True or False
print(age != 18) # Returns True or False
```

#### Indentation and Code Blocks

Python uses indentation to define blocks of code. Proper indentation is crucial as it indicates the code's structure.
```python
if age > 18:
    print("You can drive")
    print("Drive safely!")  # Part of the if block
else:
    print("You cannot drive")
```

#### Nested If/Else Statements

You can nest if/else statements to create more complex decision-making structures:
```python
if age > 0:
    if age < 18:
        print("You are a minor")
    else:
        print("You are an adult")
else:
    print("Invalid age")
```
- Here, the outer `if` checks if the age is positive. Inside the outer `if`, there is another `if` to check if the age is less than 18.

#### Elif Statement

The `elif` statement allows you to check multiple conditions:
```python
if age < 0:
    print("Invalid age")
elif age == 0:
    print("Age is zero")
elif age < 18:
    print("You are a minor")
else:
    print("You are an adult")
```
- The `elif` statement checks conditions in sequence. The first condition that evaluates to `True` will execute its block, and the rest will be ignored.

#### Practical Example

Let's create a program to decide if we can buy apples based on the price and our budget:
```python
apple_price = 210
budget = 200

if budget > apple_price:
    print("Alexa, add 1Kg apples to the cart.")
else:
    print("Alexa, do not add apples to the cart.")
```

#### Elif in Action

Using `elif` to handle multiple conditions:
```python
apple_price = 190
budget = 200

if apple_price <= budget:
    print("Alexa, add 1Kg apples to the cart.")
elif (budget - apple_price) > 50:
    print("It's OK, you can buy the apples.")
else:
    print("Alexa, do not add apples to the cart.")
```

#### Summary

Understanding and using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements are essential for decision-making in Python programming. By practicing these concepts, you can handle various scenarios and build complex programs.
