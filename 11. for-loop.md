## Introduction to Loops in Python: For Loops Explained

### Repetition in Daily Life and Programming
In both our daily routines and programming tasks, repetition is common. Just as we cook food daily or follow repeated instructions, programmers often need to perform tasks multiple times, such as printing a range of numbers. Manually writing each print statement is impractical for large ranges, which is where loops come in.

### What are Loops?
Loops allow a programmer to execute a group of statements multiple times efficiently. For example, printing numbers from 1 to 20,000 manually would be tedious, but loops simplify this task.

### Types of Loops
There are two primary types of loops in Python:
1. **For Loops**: Used to iterate over a sequence of elements (e.g., lists, strings).
2. **While Loops**: Continue to execute as long as a specified condition is true.

Nested loops (a loop within a loop) are also possible, providing flexibility in complex scenarios.

### For Loops
For loops can iterate over any iterable object in Python, such as strings, lists, and tuples. Here's a basic example:

```python
name = 'Abhishek'
for i in name:
    print(i)
```

This loop prints each character of the string 'Abhishek' on a new line.

### Iterating Over Lists
For loops can also iterate over lists:

```python
colors = ['Red', 'Green', 'Blue']
for color in colors:
    print(color)
```

To print each character of each color:

```python
for color in colors:
    for i in color:
        print(i)
```

This nested loop first prints each color and then each character of the color.

### Using the `range` Function
The `range` function is particularly useful for iterating over a sequence of numbers. The syntax `range(n)` generates numbers from 0 to n-1.

```python
for k in range(5):
    print(k)
```

To print numbers 1 to 5:

```python
for k in range(1, 6):
    print(k)
```

You can also specify a start, stop, and step:

```python
for k in range(1, 10, 2):
    print(k)  # prints 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
```

### Practical Example: Printing 1 to 20,000
Printing numbers from 1 to 20,000 using a loop:

```python
for k in range(1, 20001):
    print(k)
```

### Exploring the Step Parameter
The `range` function's third parameter, step, specifies the increment between numbers. For instance:

```python
for k in range(1, 10, 3):
    print(k)  # prints 1, 4, 7
```

### Conclusion
Understanding and utilizing loops in Python can significantly enhance the efficiency of your code by automating repetitive tasks. Experiment with different types of loops and parameters to deepen your understanding.

### Quick Quiz
Explore the step parameter of the `range` function and share your findings. Try different step values and observe the results:

```python
for k in range(1, 12, 2):
    print(k)  # prints 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11

for k in range(1, 12, 3):
    print(k)  # prints 1, 4, 7, 10
```
