## Understanding 'Break' and 'Continue' Statements in Python

### Introduction

In this part of the "100 Days Of Code" Python series, the focus is on understanding how and when to use 'Break' and 'Continue' statements within loops in Python. These statements control the flow of loops, allowing for more complex and flexible loop operations.

### Break Statements

A `break` statement in Python is used to terminate the loop containing it. When the loop encounters a `break` statement, it exits immediately, and the program continues execution at the next statement after the loop.

#### Example: Using `break` in a `for` Loop

```python
for i in range(12):
    if i == 10:
        break
    print(f"5 X {i} = {5*i}")
print("Loop exited at i = 10")
```

In this example:
- The loop runs from 0 to 11.
- When `i` equals 10, the `break` statement is executed, exiting the loop.
- The message "Loop exited at i = 10" is printed after the loop exits.

### Continue Statements

A `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration.

#### Example: Using `continue` in a `for` Loop

```python
for i in range(12):
    if i == 10:
        continue
    print(f"5 X {i} = {5*i}")
```

In this example:
- The loop runs from 0 to 11.
- When `i` equals 10, the `continue` statement is executed, skipping the current iteration and moving to the next iteration (i.e., `i = 11`).

### Practical Use of Break and Continue

- **Break Statement:** Use it when you need to exit a loop based on a specific condition. It is helpful in scenarios where you want to terminate the loop as soon as a certain condition is met.
- **Continue Statement:** Use it when you need to skip the current iteration of the loop based on a specific condition, but continue with the next iterations.

### Emulating Do-While Loop in Python

Python does not have a native `do-while` loop, but you can emulate it using a `while` loop with a `break` statement.

#### Example: Emulating Do-While Loop

```python
i = 0
while True:
    print(i)
    i += 1
    if i >= 100:
        break
```

In this example:
- The loop will execute at least once.
- The loop continues until `i` reaches 100.
- When `i` equals 100, the `break` statement is executed, terminating the loop.

### Conclusion

Understanding and using `break` and `continue` statements can significantly enhance your control over loop execution in Python. By mastering these statements, you can handle complex looping requirements efficiently.
